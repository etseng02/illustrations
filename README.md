## Description
Skedoodle is a party game designed to be played on mobile devices. Players will be able to connect from their mobile browser into a lobby displayed on a monitor or TV. Once the game starts, each player is given a word and asked to draw that word. Each drawing is passed to another player. The following player has to guess that word. The guess is passed and the next player has to draw that word. This continues until all the rounds are complete. Players will be able to visually see on the host machine (typically displayed on a big monitor) how their word and drawings have mutated over each player's iteration.

## Requirements
